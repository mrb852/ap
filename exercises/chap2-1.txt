2.1.1

The code snippet below assigns z = 4.0 if x > y OR x < 5.0

double x, y, z;
if ((x > y) || (x < 5.0)) {
  z = 4.0;
} else {
  z = 2.0;
}

2.1.2
a) for x = 10 and y = -1, z = 4.0, since 10 > -1
b) for x = 10 and y = 20, z = 2.0, since 10 < 20 and 10 > 5
c) for x = 0 and y = 20, z = 4.0, since 0 < 5.0
